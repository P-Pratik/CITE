CITE :- A initiative that refers to and connects students with their peers, seniors and juniors to aid in fluid communication between them and peer to peer learning.
Students can find people of similar interests and join groups surrounding it. They can seek guidance/advice/help from people more experienced in said field. For example if a novice wants to learn about Statistics they can easily reach out to students that are skilled or equally interested in Statistics or have participated in projects/activities involving it
Scouting people for group making for projects or other such activities can be made simpler through CITE
